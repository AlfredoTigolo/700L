          <p style="white-space: normal;">Tool is an American rock band from Los Angeles. Formed in 1990, the group's line-up includes drummer Danny
          Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, and vocalist Maynard James Keenan. Justin Chancellor has been the band's bassist
          since 1995, replacing their original bassist Paul D'Amour.
          Tool has won four Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several
          countries.
          To date, the band has released five studio albums, one EP and one box set.</p>

          <p style="white-space: normal;">They emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, Undertow (1993), and became a dominant act
          in the alternative metal movement with the release of their follow-up album Ã†nima in 1996.
          Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued
          with Lateralus (2001) and 10,000 Days (2006), gaining critical acclaim and international commercial success.
          </p>

          <p style="white-space: normal;">Their fifth studio album, Fear Inoculum, was released on August 30, 2019 to widespread critical acclaim.
          Prior to its release, the band had sold over 13 million albums in the US alone.
          Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described
          as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock.
          The relationship between the band and today's music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship, and
          the band's insistence on privacy.</p>
